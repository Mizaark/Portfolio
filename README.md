# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project I was tasked with creating a C++ program that would take user input and then output two tables, one showing investement information with additional monthly deposits, and a second one without additional monthly deposits.

# What did you do particularly well?
I am very happy with how the classes turned out. They accomplished what was needed while still being broken up enough to allow for further improvements down the line.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
If I was given the time, I would love to have attempted to learn and integrate a GUI toolkit in order to elevate the application from a text based one to a graphical interface.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging aspect of this project was getting the output to be formatted the right way. I initially struggled with limiting the output to two decimal places while maintaining a cohesive look in the table. I ended up searching throught the C++ documentation and came across the format class which did exactly what I was needing.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The main skill that I am taking away from this project would be the ability to navigate documentation in order to find a solution to a problem. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By using classes and function, I minimalized the amount of code located within the main function. This allows the program to be improved easier without having to update multiple locations.
